Welcome to COVID Times, an online platform where users can find all kinds of information regarding the covid-pandemic. There are various
components to the website, so I will address each individually. To run this website, you will need to run "flask run" and locally host it.

The website makes use of a login page where users will enter a password and a username. However, if a user does not have an account yet, the
website also has a register page where the user will be prompted to enter a username, along with a password and a confirmation password. Cases have been set
to address problems if the password and confrimation password do not match.

Once logged in, the user will be able to see COVID Times. Covid Times makes use of a sticky header/navigation bar at the top
and this is where the user will be able to navigate to different pages. Beginning with the homepage, this is general information
about covid times including contact information, a general note about this covid pandemic, a carousel slider showing a series of
images about the pandemic as well as a "STAY ALERT" message attacged to the main image in the slider, and a couple of small images displaying reminders to users about wearing masks and
to participate in quarantine to help reduce the risk of further contamination.

When a user navigates to the about page (available in the navigation bar), the user will be presented with a much more detailed response about the purpose
and mission of COVID Times. As it states, COVID Times is meant to be a source of information to users and a free non-subscription news website. Along with this, the about page
illustrates a photo of a mask in order to serve as a friendly reminder to wear a mask during this pandemic.

When a user navigates to the news page, the user will be presented with a sequence of articles, all published by the New York Times. Every article has three things associciated
with it that will be evident to the user: a corresponding image, the title of the article, and a short description (about one sentence in length) summarizing the key point of the article.
A user has the option to click the title of the article and once pressed, the user will be led to the actual article published in the New York Times. It is important to note that
every day, a different series of articles are shown based on what the New York Times publishes every day. In addition, all the news articles presented involved the topic of health, and given
the current times that we are living in, it is probable that most (if not all) articles address the topic of the pandemic in some form or fashion.

The last page, resources, is a free list of resources gathered by COVID Times that users can participate in during this time of quarantine. Among the list of
resources are codecademy, where users can learn how to code and how the web works. In addition, these resources include some helpful guides in
learning about photography and journalism. The images shown on this page, when clicked,
take the user to the respective platforms where they can learn new skills. These platforms are open on a separate tab in the browser.
